#Phred score

In FASTQ files, quality scores are commonly calculated using the Phred scale.
The Phred score is a logarithmic measure of the probability that a base (nucleotide) in a DNA sequence is called incorrectly.
It is expressed as a quality score (Q) and is calculated using the formula:

Q = -10 * log10 (P)

Where:

Q is the Phred quality score.

P is the estimated probability that the base is incorrect.

In other words, a higher Phred score indicates a higher probability of the base being called correctly, while a lower Phred score indicates 
a higher probability of an error in base calling. For example, a Phred score of 20 corresponds to a 1% chance of error, while a Phred score of 30 has 
a 0.1% chance of being an error.

#N50/N90

N50 is a measure used to describe the quality of assembled genomes that are fragmented into contigs of different lengths. It is the minimum contig length 
required to cover 50 percent of the assembled genome sequence.
N10 is the minimum contig length to cover 10 percent of the genome.
N90 is the minimum contig length to cover 90 percent of the genome.

# Coverage
It represents the number of times a specific DNA sequence has been read in a sequencing experiment.
